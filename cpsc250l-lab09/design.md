## Design Document

Be sure your design answers the following questions:
* How will you determine how many assignments are given for a specific section?
* How will you get data into your computer program?
* How will you organize the data?
* What user input is required?
* How will the user interact with the program?
* What information is required to get started running the program?


> NOTE: Write your ideas and initial design here 
 
You may create whatever source files that you desire.

I have provided a simple `grade_book.py` script that browses the data folder 
and prints the available files.  
You might make use of this code snippet in your code, 
but you are able to re-write `grade_book.py` completely.

## Milestones
