# Week 14 Individual work

You may only consult with:
* Your instructor to clarify intent of questions if needed
* https://gitlab.pcs.cnu.edu   - your personal CS150 and CS250 repo's only
* https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu    - your webcat submissions
* Your single sheet (double sided) of handwritten notes

You will also have access to the following Python documentation pages.
* https://docs.python.org/3/
* https://matplotlib.org
* https://www.numpy.org
No other help is allowed.

Fork this project to your personal `first.last.yy-cpsc250-f19` group (not your default personal group).

Clone to the local computer (and remember the folder you used).

Add the project to PyCharm.

Make sure you verify that all submissions make it to WebCat.  

This is required for full credit.

For this assignment you will be submitting
`array2d_hw.py` to WebCAT. 

Comment out any code that you cannot get to work if it is causing compilation issues on WebCat.
(Leave it in place in case I look for partial credit.)


## 2D Array and Numpy Practice
Follow the instructions written in the function definition docstrings in `array2d_hw.py`.
