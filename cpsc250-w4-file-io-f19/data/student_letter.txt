Dear students,

You should work on practicing coding more.

You can use CodingBat (www.codingbat.com) for practice of the fundamentals.
You can also try the Challenge exercises in ZyBooks, or better yet make up your own problems.

Make sure you can do all of the weekly exercises without help.
If you get help to submit, then try it again on your own (just re-fork to your personal group).

Regardless of where you start, you should work to improve your coding skills throughout the semester.
Now is the time to focus on improving your skills; you are setting your foundation for latter success.

I'm here to help, but you need to do the work of practicing your skills.

Best regards,

You beloved CPSC 250 instructor
